Hi, I’m Cherie! I’m a second-year PhD Student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Sebastian Scherer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/). I am part of the [Air Lab](http://theairlab.org/) and the [Field Robotics Center](https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/). I did my undergrad at Harvey Mudd College, where I worked with [Chris Clark](https://www.lair.hmc.edu/chris-clark) on shark-tracking underwater robots. I am currently supported by the [Croucher Foundation](https://croucher.org.hk/funding/study_awards/scholarships).
