Hi, I’m Matt! I’m a second-year [MRSD](https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/) Student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I also owned a B.S. in Biomechtronics at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), where I worked with Dr. [Ping-Lang Yen](http://140.112.183.102/RMML/profe.html) on surgical robots.
