Hi, I’m Matt! I’m a robotic software engineer with interesrs in motion planning, control, and navigation. I id my master at [MRSD](https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/) student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. At CMU, I worked with Prof. [Maxim Likhachev](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/) on planning for persistent, multi-UAV coverage. Currently, I am working on my capstone project, [Storks](https://mrsdprojects.ri.cmu.edu/2020teamf/), which we aim to develop a UAV apartment delivery system, sponsored by Prof. [Katia Sycara](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sycara/) and the [Air lab](https://theairlab.org/). I also owned a B.S. in Biomechtronics at National Taiwan University, where I worked with Dr. [Ping-Lang Yen](http://140.112.183.102/RMML/profe.html) on surgical robots.
