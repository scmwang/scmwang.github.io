Iâ€™m a robotic software engineer with interests in motion planning, control, and navigation. I was a software engineer in Robot movement team at [Miso Robotics](https://misorobotics.com/). I have earned my master degree [MRSD](https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/) from the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. At CMU, I worked on [Storks](https://mrsdprojects.ri.cmu.edu/2020teamf/), which we aim to develop a UAV apartment delivery system, sponsored by the [Air lab](https://theairlab.org/). I also owned a B.S. in Biomechtronics at National Taiwan University, where I worked with Dr. [Ping-Lang Yen](http://140.112.183.102/RMML/profe.html) on surgical robots.
